# HousePricePrediction_UsingRegression
I'm trying to predict house selling prices using regression. I'm trying to see the relationships between variables in a sample of data and then predict the prices of other sample houses. Generally, the technique I should use is machine learning. However, I want to use econometrics to make the results more meaningful.
