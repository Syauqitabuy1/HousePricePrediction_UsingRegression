# HousePricePrediction_UsingRegression

# Business Question:
How to predict the selling price of a house?

# Tools: 
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels

# Dataset: 
Downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data), accessed October 2025

# Method:
I am trying to predict those house selling prices using regression because I want to see the relationships between variables in a sample of data and then predict the prices for other sample houses by the regression model. Therefore, the technique I used in this project  was not machine learning. However, I will use econometrics to make the results more meaningful.
